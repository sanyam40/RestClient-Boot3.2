# RestClient-Boot3.2

This repository contains demo project of the latest RestClient feature introduced in Spring Boot 3.2 Milestone (M) version It showcases how to use the RestClient to make HTTP requests to external services or APIs in a Spring Boot application.

# Introduction
Spring Boot 3.2 introduces a new @RestClient annotation that simplifies making HTTP requests to external services or APIs. This annotation can be used to declare a REST client interface, and Spring Boot will automatically generate a proxy implementation for it. This makes it easy to perform RESTful operations without the need for manual HTTP client setup and configuration.

This demo project provides a hands-on guide to using the @RestClient feature in your Spring Boot applications.
